### 0. Read file

Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:

- Prototype: def read_file(filename=""):
- You must use the with statement
- You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
- You are not allowed to import any module

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
read_file = __import__('0-read_file').read_file

read_file("my_file_0.txt")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat my_file_0.txt
